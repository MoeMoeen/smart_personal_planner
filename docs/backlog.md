## plan_validator.py (logical structure of one plan)

🔍 Your Current validator.py Focuses On:
✅ Tasks, not Plans

It validates:

One task at a time (validate_task())

Or a batch of tasks (validate_task_list())

It checks whether those tasks violate:

Time overlaps

Capacity constraints

Availability rules

And while it aggregates these validations into a world-level summary, it doesn’t yet understand:

🛑 What It Does Not Validate (Yet):
❌ Plan-Level Logic:

Whether a plan’s structure makes sense (e.g., all cycles are covered)

Whether task distribution across occurrences is balanced

Whether the goal-level metadata (e.g., deadline, recurrence) is respected

❌ Goal-Plan Harmony:

Whether the plan truly achieves the user’s goal

Whether it fits within constraints like “2 sessions per week” or “done by end of month”

❌ Cross-Plan Coordination

Whether this new plan overlaps with existing plans

Whether it introduces conflicting obligations across multiple goals


| Validator Layer      | What it does now | What’s missing                              |
| -------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Task-level**       | ✅ Covered        | —                                           |
| **Plan-level**       | ❌ Not yet        | Needs goal alignment, occurrence validation |
| **Cross-plan/world** | 🟡 Partially     | Needs goal/task harmonization               |

## User Preferences on the go

You're doing exactly the right thing: pausing here is *strategically wise*. You're stepping out of the code and thinking about the **system behavior**, **user experience**, and **long-term data flows** — exactly what a product-first technical architect should do.

Let’s break this into your two questions:

---

## ✅ Q1: How will the system capture user preferences, rules, constraints — naturally and intelligently?

### ✳️ What you're aiming for:

You want your assistant to behave like a **smart, context-aware human** who:

* Understands when the user casually mentions something important
* Remembers it for the future
* Applies it proactively, without being asked again
* Confirms with the user when in doubt

You’re envisioning something like this:

---

### 🧠 Smart Conversational Memory Layer

> **“I don’t want any tasks on Sundays.”**
> → Assistant replies:
> ✅ “Got it. I’ve marked Sundays as unavailable for you. You can change this anytime.”

---

> **“Make sure to keep at least 30 minutes between my sessions.”**
> → Assistant replies:
> ✅ “Understood. I’ve added that as a scheduling rule going forward.”

---

> **“Next week I’ll be in Istanbul — block my mornings for family.”**
> → Assistant replies:
> ✅ “I’ve marked your mornings as unavailable during that trip. Want to tag it as ‘family time’?”

---

### 📦 Where does this live in the architecture?

This is where we put this logic in your Cognitive AI layers:

| UX Moment                             | Module                                 | What happens                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| User says something with a preference | 🧠 **Memory Extraction Node** (future) | The assistant detects “this is a rule/preference” and triggers extraction     |
| Rule is confirmed with user           | 🧠 **Memory Logger**                   | Saved as a `MemoryObject` of type `preference` or `constraint`                |
| Next time a plan is made              | ✅ Memory is queried                    | The preference is injected into the plan generation prompt and/or world model |
| Rules applied automatically           | 🧩 Validator / Calendarizer            | Rules like blackout windows, task spacing, etc. are applied consistently      |

✅ **YES** — this is the right long-term vision and it’s totally compatible with your current design.

We’ll formalize these later using a `UserPreferences` model (or memory type), and eventually build a `preference_extractor()` LangGraph node.

---

## ✅ Q2: Why not treat the world as fully free first, and block it as we go?

> Why not assume the user’s entire calendar is free when they start, and then:
>
> * Add task slots per confirmed plan
> * Use that state going forward
> * Sync it with Google Calendar later?

### 🧠 Great instinct. This is not only reasonable — it's already what your current architecture is doing implicitly.

Let me explain:

---

### ✅ Your current `WorldState` *is* the user’s “dynamic diary”

The `world.all_tasks` list **is your source of truth** for:

* When the user is booked
* Which slots are taken
* What tasks are where

When a new user signs up:

* You create an empty `WorldState` with no `all_tasks`
* The system treats **everything within availability windows** as free
* Then it books time as plans are accepted

So yes — **the logic in `query.py` just reflects this dynamic calendar**. It:

* Checks availability windows
* Compares against currently scheduled tasks (`world.all_tasks`)
* Returns what’s free **right now**, as of this user’s world state

✅ The behavior you described — *“treating the calendar as free until booked”* — is exactly how this system works.

---

### 🔁 Bonus: Google Calendar Integration

You will later create a background sync process that:

* Reads from Google Calendar
* Converts Google Events into `CalendarizedTask` entries in `WorldState`
* Merges them with tasks created by the assistant
* Optionally shows the assistant which blocks are `external`

This will let the system coordinate intelligently across:

* Assistant-generated plans
* User's external obligations

We can even add a `source: "assistant" | "external"` field to `CalendarizedTask` to keep track.

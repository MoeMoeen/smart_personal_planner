# ‚úÖ Checkpoint: Updated Intent Recognition & Dynamic Routing Strategy (LangGraph)

Absolutely, brother. Here's a **precise and structured checkpoint** to document our latest decisions and architectural directions regarding **intent recognition, routing, and dynamic flow construction**.

---

# ‚úÖ **Checkpoint ‚Äì 2025-08-30**

**Title:** Dynamic Intent Recognition + LLM-Based Flow Wiring Architecture

---

## üß† **High-Level Architecture Updates**

### 1. **Unified Intent Recognition + Strategy Planning + Router Node**

* The `IntentRecognitionNode` is now the **core cognitive brain**.
* It handles:

  * Intent detection from user message and context.
  * Mapping the intent to the **right intent in the registry**.
  * Deciding on the **sequence of nodes/tools** to run next.
  * **Building or selecting** the node execution path.

> This eliminates the need for separate router or strategy interpretation nodes.

---

## üß≠ **Execution Strategy Logic**

### ‚úÖ Strategy: Hybrid Approach (Preferred)

* **Primary strategy:** Use LLM to dynamically determine the sequence of nodes/tools per intent.
* **Fallback strategy:** Use predefined deterministic flows per intent if the LLM fails.

### ‚úÖ Implementation Plan:

```python
def determine_execution_strategy(intent, memory_context, all_tools, all_nodes) -> List[str]:
    try:
        return llm_generate_dynamic_sequence(intent, memory_context, all_tools, all_nodes)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warn(f"LLM failed: {e}")
        return DEFAULT_FLOW_REGISTRY[intent]
```

---

## üß∞ **Tool & Node Registry for LLM**

* Every node/tool must be described with:

  * `name`, `type`, `description`, `inputs`, `outputs`
  * Optional: latency, cost, memory requirements

This will be passed to the LLM to **help it compose a strategy** intelligently.
---

## üß© **Two Flow Composition Strategies**

### \[Option 1] **LLM-Based Dynamic Flow**

* LLM receives:

  * Recognized intent
  * MemoryContext summary
  * User message
  * Tool/node registry
* Returns:

  ```json
  {
    "sequence": ["plan_outline", "user_confirm_a", "task_generation", "calendarize"],
    "explanation": "Based on user's intent to revise a plan..."
  }
  ```

### \[Option 2] **Fallback Deterministic Mapping**

* Static map:

```python
DEFAULT_FLOW_REGISTRY = {
  "create_new_plan": ["plan_outline", "user_confirm_a", "task_generation", "calendarize"],
  "give_feedback": ["feedback_logger"],
  ...
}
```

---

## üîÑ **Every Message Flow Summary**

1. User sends message (via web/Telegram/other client).
2. Server receives the message and updates state.
3. **IntentRecognitionNode is called**:

   * Recognizes intent
   * Determines flow strategy
   * Triggers next node
5. Repeat until `is_complete = True` in state

---

## üóÇÔ∏è **Next Steps**

1. ‚úÖ Finalize `IntentRecognitionNode` logic with LLM strategy + fallback
2. ‚è≥ Define LLM prompt for dynamic strategy planning
3. ‚è≥ Build registry of nodes/tools (with metadata for LLM)
4. ‚è≥ Refactor graph wiring to go back to `IntentRecognitionNode` after each major node
5. ‚è≥ Add support in GraphState to hold execution history (for loop prevention, logging)
6. ‚è≥ (Optional) Build a FlowCompiler class to abstract edge creation dynamically

---
---

## ‚úÖ Core Design Principles (Latest)

1. **Single Entry Point per User Message**  
   - `IntentRecognitionNode` is the **first node triggered** when a new user message arrives.
   - It analyzes the user input, conversation context, and MemoryContext to detect the intent.

2. **LLM-Based or Deterministic Flow Selection**  
   After recognizing the intent:
   - The system either:
     - üîÆ Uses an LLM to determine the best sequence of nodes/tools dynamically, OR
     - üìò Uses a pre-mapped deterministic sequence defined per intent in a registry

3. **Dynamic Graph Rewiring**
   - Once the sequence is determined, the `IntentRecognitionNode`:
     - Defines the correct node order
     - Uses `builder.add_edge(...)` to wire the graph
     - Executes the flow end-to-end for that message

### üß† High-Level Architecture Updates

Unified Intent Recognition + Strategy Planning + Router Node

The IntentRecognitionNode is now the core cognitive brain.

It handles:

Intent detection from user message and context.

Mapping the intent to the right intent in the registry.

Deciding on the sequence of nodes/tools to run next.

Building or selecting the node execution path.

This eliminates the need for separate router or strategy interpretation nodes.

## üß† Recap of IntentRecognitionNode Role

| Phase                        | Responsibility                                          |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| After User Message          | Run LLM-based intent recognition                        |
| After Intent Is Recognized | Select node/tool sequence using LLM or predefined map   |
| During Flow Execution       | **No need** to route back to intent node                |
| Next User Message           | Trigger intent node again (start next turn)             |

### Global Brain vs Local Mini Brains

---

## 1) where do the ‚Äúparameters‚Äù come from?

* **not preset** (not a static list of keys).
* the **intent recognition brain (LLM)** decides on the fly what parameters to output, based on the user message.
* but we give it a **schema** in the prompt: always return JSON with at least `"intent"` + `"parameters": {}`.
* inside `"parameters"`, the model is free to include whatever keys/values it thinks are relevant.

example:

user says: *‚Äúremove all tasks in 3rd week of September and shorten goal A tasks‚Äù*

intent recognition LLM outputs:

```json
{
  "intent": "refine_tasks",
  "parameters": {
    "remove_date_range": "2025-09-15 to 2025-09-21",
    "adjust_goal_A": {"factor": 0.8}
  },
  "confidence": 0.92,
  "notes": "User requested blackout in September and duration adjustment for goal A"
}
```

‚Üí here `"remove_date_range"` and `"adjust_goal_A"` are **not hardcoded**.
the LLM invented them to structure the feedback.
later, the node (or sub-agent inside it) interprets these keys to decide which tools to use.

---

## 2) who decides which tools are available in `task_generation`?

this is about **scope of tools**.

* each node can declare its **own toolset**.
  e.g., `task_generation` node might register these:

  * `remove_tasks_by_date`
  * `adjust_task_duration`
  * `add_task`
  * `merge_tasks`

* when the node spins up a sub-agent (LLM), it hands the LLM **this toolset**.

* the LLM then decides **which of these tools to call, with which parameters**, based on the `"parameters"` it received from the brain + the raw user feedback.

so:

1. **global brain (intent recognition)**:
   decides: *‚Äúwe are still in the `task_generation` stage; here‚Äôs the structured feedback parameters.‚Äù*

2. **local micro-brain inside task\_generation node**:

   * sees those parameters,
   * has access to a toolbox (remove/adjust/etc.),
   * decides: *‚Äúah, to satisfy ‚Äòremove\_date\_range‚Äô I must call `remove_tasks_by_date`.
     to satisfy ‚Äòadjust\_goal\_A‚Äô I must call `adjust_task_duration`.‚Äù*

3. **tools** execute the actual domain logic (ORM updates, WorldUpdater ops, Memory logging).

---

‚úÖ so your assumption is correct:

* the LLM inside the node should have access to **all tools relevant for that node**.
* it will pick and call the ones it needs.
* the outer brain doesn‚Äôt micromanage which exact tool to use, it only says *‚Äúroute back into task\_generation with these feedback params‚Äù*.
* the micro-brain does the surgical work.

---

üí° think of it like layers of command:

* **outer brain** = a general (decides which battlefield to fight on).
* **node‚Äôs micro-brain** = a field commander with a toolbox of tactics.
* **tools** = the actual soldiers carrying out the tactical actions.

---


## üåç The Misalignment Problem

* **global brain (general)**: knows the **conversation history**, **user preferences**, **world model**, **memory** ‚Üí can reason across all goals.
* **local micro-brains (field commanders)**: only see the **immediate node scope** (tasks, outline). if left isolated, they can make decisions that clash with the big picture.

‚Üí result: fragmentation.
the outline might reflect preferences, but the task adjustments might ignore them. tasks may optimize locally but hurt other goals globally. exactly the silo effect you fear.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è the solution: structured communication

to prevent silos, we enforce **two-way communication** between global and local brains:

### 1. global brain ‚Üí local micro-brain

* when the global brain routes into a node, it doesn‚Äôt just say: *‚Äúgo to task\_generation with parameters.‚Äù*
* it also passes **context bundles**: memory summary, preferences, constraints, higher-level intent.

so the local agent **always starts with global context**.

```json
{
  "intent": "refine_tasks",
  "parameters": {"feedback": "..."},
  "context": {
    "user_preferences": {...},
    "blackout_periods": [...],
    "conversation_summary": "...",
    "linked_goals": ["fitness", "career"]
  }
}
```

### 2. local micro-brain ‚Üí global brain

* when the node finishes, it doesn‚Äôt just return ‚Äútasks‚Äù.
* it also reports a **summary of what actions it took**.
* e.g.: ‚Äúremoved 3 tasks from week of Sep 15; shortened durations for Goal A by 20%.‚Äù

this is fed back into **global memory** (semantic + episodic) so the global brain learns what happened.

---

## üîÑ continuous alignment loop

* **global ‚Üí local**: context injection.
* **local ‚Üí global**: action reporting (structured logs + summaries).
* **memory layer**: keeps both sides in sync, so that at the next user message, the global brain knows exactly what each local micro-brain has already done.

---

## üß© practical design patterns

1. **contracts (schemas)**

   * every node (esp. micro-brain nodes) must take a `context` object and return an `outcome` object with `summary` + `actions`.
   * this enforces structured handshakes.

2. **shared world model**

   * both global and local brains read/write from the **same world model state**.
   * e.g., blackout periods, user preferences, priorities ‚Üí live in `WorldState`.
   * nodes can‚Äôt ignore them because they‚Äôre part of the state they operate on.

3. **semantic memory logging**

   * local node logs each change into semantic memory.
   * global brain has access to those logs when interpreting the next user message.

---

## üéØ example flow (your September scenario)

1. user: *‚Äúremove tasks from 3rd week of September, shorten goal A tasks, extend goal B.‚Äù*
2. **intent recognition brain**:

   * intent = `refine_tasks`
   * parameters = {date\_range: Sep15‚ÄìSep21, adjust\_goal\_A: 0.8, adjust\_goal\_B: 1.2}
   * context injected = blackout periods, user prefs, linked goals.
   * ‚Üí routes to `task_generation` node.
3. **task\_generation micro-brain**:

   * sees context (knows blackout = Sep15‚Äì21 already in world model)
   * decides: call `remove_tasks_by_date`, `adjust_task_duration` twice.
   * returns tasks + summary: ‚Äúremoved X tasks, adjusted durations A/B.‚Äù
4. **global brain** logs this outcome into memory + world model.

   * next time, if user says: *‚Äúwhy did you change my tasks?‚Äù* ‚Üí global brain can explain, because it has the action summary from the node.

---

## üîí why this works

* local brains never act in isolation: they‚Äôre seeded with **global context**.
* global brain never loses track: every local action is summarized back.
* memory + world model act as the **shared substrate**.
* contracts enforce that communication is always structured, not ad-hoc.

---

Now let‚Äôs sketch the **full pipeline** end-to-end, adding the ‚Äústep before planner agent‚Äù so the whole flow makes sense in your architecture.

---

# ‚ö° Pipeline: From User ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Compiler ‚Üí Execution

## **Step 0. User Input**

* User sends a message (e.g. *‚ÄúMake me a roadmap for launching my product‚Äù*).
* This goes into the system as the initial `state["messages"]`.

---

## **Step 1. Intent Recognition Agent**

* First node is **always-on brain interface** (intent recognizer).
* It looks at the user‚Äôs message and classifies intent:

  * `"roadmap_request"`
  * `"competitor_analysis"`
  * `"simple_question"`
* Output: `state["intent"] = "roadmap_request"`

üëâ **This is what decides whether we need to trigger the planner agent at all.**

* If intent = ‚Äúchitchat‚Äù, no plan.
* If intent = ‚Äúroadmap\_request‚Äù, **trigger planner agent.**

---

## **Step 2. Planner Agent**

* Triggered **only if needed** (based on intent).
* Planner is an LLM-powered agent whose job is:

  * Translate high-level intent ‚Üí a **plan** (list of node names).
  * Example output:

    ```python
    plan = ["intent_recognition", "entity_extraction", "planner", "executor"]
    ```
* Planner might even generate conditional branches like:

  * ‚ÄúIf missing data ‚Üí route to clarification\_node.‚Äù

---

## **Step 3. FlowCompiler**

* Now we pass the `plan` into **FlowCompiler** along with the `registry` of known NodeSpecs.
* FlowCompiler responsibilities:

  * Verify nodes exist.
  * Check no cycles.
  * Insert missing dependencies.
  * Resolve callables.
  * Wrap with pre/post hooks.
  * Add linear edges (`A ‚Üí B ‚Üí C`).
* Output: **compiled graph** (nodes + edges + routers).

üëâ Compile happens once per plan.

---

## **Step 4. Execution Engine (GraphBuilder / Runner)**

* The compiled graph is now executed with the current `state`.
* Execution rules:

  * Follow edges statically.
  * If a node has a **conditional router**, call it to decide next node dynamically.
  * Fire **pre\_hook** before each node.
  * Fire **post\_hook** after each node.
* Example run:

  ```
  PRE intent_recognition
  POST intent_recognition ‚Üí intent=roadmap_request
  PRE entity_extraction
  POST entity_extraction ‚Üí entities=['market', 'budget']
  PRE planner
  POST planner ‚Üí {'plan': '3-step roadmap'}
  PRE executor
  POST executor ‚Üí {'output': 'Here is your roadmap‚Ä¶'}
  ```

---

# üîπ Visual Map (simplified)

```
User ‚Üí IntentRecognition ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚ñ∫ [if tasky intent ‚Üí Planner Agent]
                             ‚îÇ
                             ‚ñº
                      FlowCompiler.compile(plan)
                             ‚îÇ
                             ‚ñº
                       Execution Engine
                    (hooks + routers + edges)
```

---

# ‚úÖ Key Takeaways

1. **Intent Recognition Node** = gatekeeper. Decides if planner agent should be triggered.
2. **Planner Agent** = dynamic LLM brain that outputs a *plan* (sequence of nodes).
3. **FlowCompiler** = takes plan + registry, turns into executable graph.
4. **Execution Engine** = runs the graph, node by node, with runtime dynamism (routers/hooks).

### üîπ End-to-End User-Agent Flow (Updated)

1. User Initiation

The user starts an interaction with the agent.

2. Intent Recognition Node

The agent identifies and classifies the user‚Äôs primary intent (high-level goal for this run).

3. Strategy Interpretation Node

The agent converts the user‚Äôs input into a GoalSpec (a structured representation of the user‚Äôs goal).

4. Plan Structure Outline Node

The agent creates a high-level plan outline, including:

Occurrences and cycles

Overall structure of the plan

(Tasks are not generated at this stage)


The outline is shared with the user.

5. User Confirmation A

The user reviews and either confirms or rejects the Goal Spec and plan outline.

If rejected, the router node re-runs the necessary nodes to adjust or regenerate the outline.

6. Detailed Task Generation Node

If confirmed, the agent expands each occurrence into structured, detailed tasks.

7. World Model Integration Node

The plan is enriched with:

User‚Äôs calendar data

Blackout periods

Capacity constraints

Other contextual information

8. Calendarization & Time Allocation Node

Assigns time slots to each task, based on world model constraints.

9. Validation Node

Performs rule-based checks for overlaps, violations, and scheduling conflicts.

10. User Confirmation B

The agent presents the full detailed plan (with tasks, timings, constraints) for user approval.

If rejected, the router node dynamically determines which steps to repeat to refine the plan.

11. Persistence Node

On approval, the plan is:

Saved to the database

Logged in memory

Scheduled in external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar)

### üîπ Conversation & Mini-Intent Handling (Dynamic Routing)

Dynamic Mini-Intent Detection:

At every user message, the system evaluates if the user:

Gives feedback

Changes the topic or goal

Switches to another supported intent

Asks a general/random question


These are classified as mini-intents (subsets or deviations from the overall goal).


Router Node + Graph State Coordination:

The Router Node and Graph State work together to:

Re-sequence nodes dynamically based on the detected mini-intent.

Support iterative refinements (especially if the user rejects outputs at Confirmation A or B).

Allow topic switching without breaking the flow.



### 

OK, and then the overall flow, just to refresh your memories, the flow starts with the user starting the interaction with the agent, and the agent starting with identifying and recognizing the intent of the user. That's the intent recognition node. And then there is a strategy interpretation node, which is essentially the agent converting the user input into a structure called a spec. And then generating a plan structure outline in the plan structure outline, or plan structure node, or plan outline node, in which the agent generates a detailed plan outline, including occurrences, cycles, and all the details, and the tasks, and everything else. Maybe not the tasks, but the occurrences and cycles, and the overall plan. And shares with the user. And the user then either confirms or rejects with a feedback. That's where we have the user confirmation A. Ask user to confirm goal and outline. And if it's confirmed, then the agent starts detailing the tasks under the outline, under the plan outline. So it's a detailed task generation node, which essentially expands each occurrence into a structured task. Then we have a world model integration step. Injection of current calendar, blackouts, capacity, and everything else. And then we have a calendarization and time allocation nodes, assigning time slots to each task. And then we have a validation node. It's like a rule-based check for overlaps, violations, and all. And we have another user confirmation, or user confirmation B. Show the final plan, including the tasks and all the details, end-to-end to user for approval. And if approved, then we have the persistence node, saving the plan to database, log memory object, and even scheduling on external calendars, like Google Calendar and all. And a very important point is that along the whole conversation between the user and agent, the user might talk about different things. So then we should have some sort of a conversation node as well. And at every conversation, there should be some sort of identification of what the user wants now. It's like a subset of the overall goal or intent of the user. So I call them mini-intents. But we can implement this via a router node plus graph state, which will decide at every single conversation by the user which sequence or order of nodes should be implemented now or dynamically adapted to what the user needs.

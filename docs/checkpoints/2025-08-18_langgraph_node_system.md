# Checkpoint: LangGraph Node System Progress (18 August 2025)

## Where We Are and the Road Ahead

### ðŸŸ¢ Completed
- Intent recognition node implemented. TODO: self learning new intents
- New LangGraph workflow scaffolded.

### ðŸŸ¡ Remaining Steps

#### 4. Design and Implement New LangGraph Node System
- Implement nodes for: strategy interpretation, plan outline, task generation, world model integration, calendarization, validation, user confirmation, persistence.
- Ensure each node has a clear contract and is testable in isolation.

#### 5. Inject MemoryContext into Every Node
- Systematically inject and utilize MemoryContext in all nodes.

#### 6. Wire World Model into Graph Nodes
- Ensure all relevant nodes receive and update world state as needed.

#### 7. Implement LLM-Based Intelligent Memory Routing
- Replace rule-based routing with LLM-powered context analysis for memory selection.

#### 8. Integrate Semantic Memory with Vector DB
- Complete vector DB setup and connect semantic memory to router and nodes.

#### 9. Implement Learning and Feedback Loop
- Update semantic memory with outcomes and use learned patterns for future planning.
- Build a self-learning intent discovery pipeline (log, cluster, propose, validate, and refine intents).

#### 10. Add Dialogue and User Feedback Nodes
- Implement nodes for user clarification, feedback, and corrections.
- Add dialogue flows to confirm, refine, or reject new intent proposals with the user. TODO

#### 11. Implement Reasoning and Prioritization Logic
- Add logic for prioritization, plan comparison, and goal tradeoffs.

#### 12. Observability, Logging, and Undo/Redo
- Add structured logging and undo/redo to all nodes and tools.

#### 13. Remove/Archive/Refactor Legacy Code
- Archive/refactor all legacy code in agent/ and ai/ folders.
- Remove or modularize any remaining monolithic planner/task logic.
- Delete/archive files not aligned with the new cognitive AI architecture.

## Step 4: Design and Implement New LangGraph Node System

### Nodes to Implement (in order):
1. Strategy Interpretation Node
2. Plan Outline Node
3. Task Generation Node
4. World Model Integration Node
5. Calendarization Node
6. Validation Node
7. User Confirmation Node
8. Persistence Node

For each node:
- Create a clear, isolated contract (input/output dataclasses or Pydantic models).
- Implement as a class/function in the nodes/ folder.
- Inject both WorldModel and MemoryContext into the node.
- Ensure the node is testable in isolation.

### Next Immediate Action: Strategy Interpretation Node
- Scaffold the node in the nodes/ folder.
- Define its contract (input/output).
- Show how WorldModel and MemoryContext are injected.
- Define the contract details for the Strategy Interpretation Node
- Integrate this node into the graph

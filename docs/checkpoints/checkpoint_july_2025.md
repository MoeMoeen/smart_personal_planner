‚úÖ Checkpoint Summary: Plan Feedback and Refinement Logic (Mid-July 2025)

üìç Core Features Implemented

1. Completed the /plan-feedback endpoint in routers/planning.py, with full handling of both user actions:

Approval path (PlanFeedbackAction.APPROVE):

Saves the feedback.

Approves the current plan and unapproves all other plans for the same goal.

Returns a clean response using the PlanFeedbackResponse Pydantic schema.


Refinement path (PlanFeedbackAction.REQUEST_REFINEMENT):

Saves the feedback.

Triggers generate_refined_plan_from_feedback(), which:

Aggregates all feedback for the given goal.

Builds a structured refinement prompt.

Includes the most recent plan summary in the prompt as context.


The new plan is saved using save_generated_plan() with metadata.

Returns the refined plan with appropriate response data.




2. Prompt Engineering Enhancements

Designed a refinement prompt format that includes:

Accumulated feedback text from previous rounds.

The most recent (rejected) plan in structured summary format.


Ensures better context for the LLM to improve output iteratively.



3. Refinement Metadata Tracking

Added 2 fields to the plans table via Alembic migration:

refinement_round: tracks the round number.

refined_from_plan_id: foreign key to the parent plan.


This supports:

Analytics of user iteration behavior.

Better UX feedback in the future ("You‚Äôre on refinement round 3").




4. Database + Pydantic Model Updates

Updated Plan model in models.py.

Added the new metadata fields to the GeneratedPlan Pydantic schema in ai/schemas.py.

Logic in save_generated_plan() was updated to:

Auto-calculate the next refinement round.

Assign parent refined_from_plan_id.




5. Swagger + Testing Readiness

All changes are reflected in response models for Swagger auto-documentation.

System is ready for full test via Swagger UI.

üìå Additional Notes (Important Context)

‚úÖ Business logic enforced: Only one approved plan per goal at a time.

‚úÖ Transactions now use with db.begin() to ensure atomic commits and rollback safety.

‚úÖ We agreed that refinements don‚Äôt have to be from approved plans only ‚Äî the system supports refining any previously generated plan.

‚úÖ The current setup automatically saves each generated plan to the DB, so refinements always have a valid base plan to build on.

### ðŸ”¹ End-to-End Agent Flow (Updated)

1. User Initiation

The user starts an interaction with the agent.

2. Intent Recognition Node

The agent identifies and classifies the userâ€™s primary intent (high-level goal for this run).

3. Strategy Interpretation Node

The agent converts the userâ€™s input into a GoalSpec (a structured representation of the userâ€™s goal).

4. Plan Structure Outline Node

The agent creates a high-level plan outline, including:

Occurrences and cycles

Overall structure of the plan

(Tasks are not generated at this stage)


The outline is shared with the user.

5. User Confirmation A

The user reviews and either confirms or rejects the Goal Spec and plan outline.

If rejected, the router node re-runs the necessary nodes to adjust or regenerate the outline.

6. Detailed Task Generation Node

If confirmed, the agent expands each occurrence into structured, detailed tasks.

7. World Model Integration Node

The plan is enriched with:

Userâ€™s calendar data

Blackout periods

Capacity constraints

Other contextual information

8. Calendarization & Time Allocation Node

Assigns time slots to each task, based on world model constraints.

9. Validation Node

Performs rule-based checks for overlaps, violations, and scheduling conflicts.

10. User Confirmation B

The agent presents the full detailed plan (with tasks, timings, constraints) for user approval.

If rejected, the router node dynamically determines which steps to repeat to refine the plan.

11. Persistence Node

On approval, the plan is:

Saved to the database

Logged in memory

Scheduled in external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar)

### ðŸ”¹ Conversation & Mini-Intent Handling (Dynamic Routing)

Dynamic Mini-Intent Detection:

At every user message, the system evaluates if the user:

Gives feedback

Changes the topic or goal

Switches to another supported intent

Asks a general/random question


These are classified as mini-intents (subsets or deviations from the overall goal).


Router Node + Graph State Coordination:

The Router Node and Graph State work together to:

Re-sequence nodes dynamically based on the detected mini-intent.

Support iterative refinements (especially if the user rejects outputs at Confirmation A or B).

Allow topic switching without breaking the flow.



### 

OK, and then the overall flow, just to refresh your memories, the flow starts with the user starting the interaction with the agent, and the agent starting with identifying and recognizing the intent of the user. That's the intent recognition node. And then there is a strategy interpretation node, which is essentially the agent converting the user input into a structure called a spec. And then generating a plan structure outline in the plan structure outline, or plan structure node, or plan outline node, in which the agent generates a detailed plan outline, including occurrences, cycles, and all the details, and the tasks, and everything else. Maybe not the tasks, but the occurrences and cycles, and the overall plan. And shares with the user. And the user then either confirms or rejects with a feedback. That's where we have the user confirmation A. Ask user to confirm goal and outline. And if it's confirmed, then the agent starts detailing the tasks under the outline, under the plan outline. So it's a detailed task generation node, which essentially expands each occurrence into a structured task. Then we have a world model integration step. Injection of current calendar, blackouts, capacity, and everything else. And then we have a calendarization and time allocation nodes, assigning time slots to each task. And then we have a validation node. It's like a rule-based check for overlaps, violations, and all. And we have another user confirmation, or user confirmation B. Show the final plan, including the tasks and all the details, end-to-end to user for approval. And if approved, then we have the persistence node, saving the plan to database, log memory object, and even scheduling on external calendars, like Google Calendar and all. And a very important point is that along the whole conversation between the user and agent, the user might talk about different things. So then we should have some sort of a conversation node as well. And at every conversation, there should be some sort of identification of what the user wants now. It's like a subset of the overall goal or intent of the user. So I call them mini-intents. But we can implement this via a router node plus graph state, which will decide at every single conversation by the user which sequence or order of nodes should be implemented now or dynamically adapted to what the user needs.
